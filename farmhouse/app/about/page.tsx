But beneath that steady nature is a friendly heart‚Äîhe‚Äôs always happy to welcome a pat or walk beside you once he‚Äôs decided you‚Äôre a friend.

When she is not chasing after a ball or racing across the yard, she‚Äôs the most lovable cuddle bug, curling up in her bed and drifting into the coziest sleep.

           Our farm, originally built in 1901 and purchased by our family in 2018, has become a cherished place where we gather to reconnect, and make lasting memories together and with our friends. 
After a busy and sometimes stressful week, escaping to the farm feels like a breath of fresh air. The serene fields and glowing sunsets invite you to slow down and unwind. There is nothing quite like spending time with the animals, letting their presence sooth and refresh you.  
We began with adopting our dogs Harley and Mars. Harley is half hound half boxer and Mars is a Golden Retriever. They both are  happy and friendly dogs that enjoy  interacting and playing with those around them. They also help take care of our farm and the other animals!  
We then adopted many chickens and baby chicks and along the way learned how to create a healthy environment for them to thrive in. Our chickens provide us with fresh eggs to eat on a daily!
To expand our farm family even more, we brought in some beautiful peacocks, mischievous goats and the three cutest cats! 
All of these farm members add to the farm by bringing joy, life and a sense of wonder to every corner.
Whether you are looking for a retreat, a chance to capture timeless photos, or simply a day surrounded by nature and happy memories, our farm feels like a world apart. Explore sunlit fields, watch the sky glow at sunset, and meet animals that seem to have their own stories to tell. Here, every moment sparkles with wonder and creates memories that linger long after you leave.
